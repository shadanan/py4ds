# Read a File and Return a List of Numbers

- Problem: [problem.py](problem.py)
- Tests: [tests.py](tests.py)
- Solution: [solution.py](solution.py)

A common operation that we do with pandas is `pd.read_csv`, which reads a csv file and returns a pandas DataFrame. In this exercise, we will read a file _without_ using pandas.

Given a file name, read the file and return a list of integers. The [file](data1.dat) contains integers, with each integer on a new line.

> **_Hint: You can write a main function if you'd like! Add this to the bottom of your problem.py file._**
>
> ```python
> if __name__ == "__main__":
>     print(load_data("p6136/data1.dat"))
> ```
>
> With a main function, you can run your script by clicking the play button in the top right of VS Code.
