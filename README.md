# Python for Data Scientists

This is a short course for data scientists that spend a lot of time working with pandas but may want to practice their pure Python skills.

The course is presented in the style of LeetCode. You have a series of problems to solve. Every problem has an instructions markdown file (index.md), a file with tests (tests.py), a python file where you are to write the solution to the problem (problem.py), and a python file with our solution (solution.py). For example:

- Instructions: [index.md](p9893/index.md)
- Tests: [tests.py](p9893/tests.py)
- Problem: [problem.py](p9893/problem.py)
- Our Solution: [solution.py](p9893/solution.py)

## Getting Started

1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
1. Clone this repository.
1. Open [py4ds.code-workspace](py4ds.code-workspace).
1. Install the recommended extensions. VS Code should prompt you.
1. Open a terminal and install the project dependencies:
   ```sh
   $ uv sync
   ```

## Solve Problem 0

In VS Code, right click **_README.md_** in the Explorer pane, and then click on **_Open Preview_**. This will open these instructions in preview mode so that you can follow the links in these markdown files.

Now, follow the link to [Problem 0](p9893/index.md)!
