# Sum of Two Values

This warmup question will ensure that you've set up your environment properly!

Your goal is to implement this function:

```python
def sum_of_two_values(val1: int, val2: int) -> int:
    pass
```

It should add `val1` to `val2` and return the result. For example, if `val1 = 2` and `val2 = 3`, `sum_of_two_values` should return `5`.

To check if you did it correctly, run the tests for your file:

- Open the [tests.py](tests.py) file.
- Open the command palette by pressing: ⌘⇧P (Command + Shift + P)
- Run the command: `Test: Run Tests in Current File`

If you did it correctly, the tests should pass and will be green!
