# Sum of Two Values

- Problem: [problem.py](problem.py) _(create this file)_
- Template: [template.py](template.py) _(copy starter code from here)_
- Tests: [test_all.py](test_all.py) _(tests that verify your solution)_
- Solution: [solution.py](solution.py) _(our solution)_

This warmup question will ensure that you've set up your environment properly!

## Problem Statement

Your goal is to implement [problem.py](problem.py) which doesn't exist yet. After clicking the link, click "Create File", and copy the starter code from [template.py](template.py).

```python
def sum_of_two_values(val1: int, val2: int) -> int:
    pass
```

It should add `val1` to `val2` and return the result. For example, if `val1 = 2` and `val2 = 3`, `sum_of_two_values` should return `5`.

> **_Hint: Open [problem.py](problem.py) and drag it over to the right so that you can have the instructions visible side by side!_**

To check if you did it correctly, run the tests for your file:

- Open the [test_all.py](test_all.py) file.
- Open the command palette by pressing: ⌘⇧P (Command + Shift + P)
- Run the command: `Test: Run Tests in Current File`

If you did it correctly, the tests should pass and will be green!
