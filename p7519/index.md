In [Read CSV as List of Dictionaries](../p6897/index.md), we wrote a function that reads a CSV file and returns it as a list of dictionaries.

In this problem, we will write a function that takes a list of dictionaries that represent [salaries](../data/salaries.csv), and select those rows where the salary column is more than $100,000.
